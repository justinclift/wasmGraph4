### Another simple example using Go Wasm with the HTML5 Canvas (2D)

Online demo: https://justinclift.github.io/wasmGraph4/

This renders a basic XY graph, and it's first derivative, onto the
2D canvas.

Use the wasd, arrow, and numpad keys (including + and -) to rotate the
graph around the origin.  Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

The code for this started from https://github.com/stdiopt/gowasm-experiments,
and has been fairly radically reworked from there. :smile:
